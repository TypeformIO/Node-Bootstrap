This is a bootstrap application that you can use to kickstart development when
you want to use Typeform I/O. It's very basic at the moment and does not do
a lot but it's useful to look at when you want to know how to use Typeform I/O
in a node environment

## Requirements

* An working internet connection (for local exposure via [Localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) and rendering of the forms)

## Installing

* Clone this project into your local computer
* run `npm install` inside the cloned project

## Running

To run this application, you'll need to have a Typeform I/O API-key already. If
